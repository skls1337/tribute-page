                            The legendary manga artist who was an inspiration to many
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Kentaro Miura was born on July 11th, 1966 in Chiba, Chiba Prefecture, Japan to two artists who were students at Musashino Arts School. His father created storyboards for commericals and his mother was an art teacher, which resulted in a naturally constructed artistic environment that inspired him to draw. Thus, in 1973, he began experimenting with drawing in a notebook.

                            From the very young age of 10 years old in 1976, he created his first manga for his schoolmates in a school publication, called Miuranger, which spanned 40 total volumes. However, this was never published in any official formats, so original artwork and storyline is unknown. In fact, one image is commonly mistakened to be from Miuranger, but is actually from his one-shot post-apocalyptic story, Noa.

                            The best manga ever, Berserk, first appeared in 1988. This version is what we now call Berserk: The Prototype - a 48 paged manga that won Miura a prize from a Manga School.
